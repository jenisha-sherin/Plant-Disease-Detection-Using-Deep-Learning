# Plant-Disease-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
Develop an automated system to detect and classify plant diseases from leaf images using deep learning. Gather and preprocess images, train a CNN model, and deploy it via a mobile app. This tool aids farmers in early disease detection, improving crop yields, and reducing losses. It's accurate, cost-effective, and accessible
